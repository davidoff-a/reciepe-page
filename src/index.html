          Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
          recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny
          its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

          <ol class="list number">
            <li class="list__item number">
              Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven
              to 350°F (177°C).
            </li>
            <li class="list__item number">
              <span>Make the crust:</span> Using a food processor, pulse the
              graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in
              sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all
              together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press
              firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or
              10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the
              bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake
              for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a
              large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan
              for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you
              prepare the filling.
            </li>
            <li class="list__item number">
              <span>Make the filling:</span> Using a handheld or stand mixer
              fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and
              granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
              until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the
              sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully
              combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating
              after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is
              incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the
              cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid
              over-mixing the batter as best you can.
            </li>
            <li class="list__item number">
              <span>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</span> Boil a pot
              of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the
              water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle
              of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil
              around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of
              the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even
              layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully
              pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or
              you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the
              hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
            </li>
            <li class="list__item number">
              Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
              set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
              wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the
              oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the
              water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and
              water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature.
              Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li class="list__item number">
              Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
              springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
              cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean
              and dip into warm water between each slice.
            </li>
            <li class="list__item number">
              Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
              cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
